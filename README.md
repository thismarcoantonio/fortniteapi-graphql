# Free Fortnite GraphQL API
This project is a wrapper of [Public Fortnite REST API](https://fortniteapi.com/). If you like it, please, consider make a donate.

## Usage & limits
This API is free to use. As this is just a wrapper of an API, at the moment there are no limits at this time. This can change at any time. There would never be a limit per second or minute. All rights go to Epic Games.

## Getting started
Check the demo here: ðŸš§Under construction

## Information
With this API you'll be able to search to **items**, **daily store**, **upcoming items**, **user profile/stats**, **challenges**, **news** and **server status!
